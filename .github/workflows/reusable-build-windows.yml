# Windows Build Workflow (reusable)
#
# SYNOPSIS
#   Automates the Windows build process using GitHub Actions.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   This workflow is designed to be reusable via `workflow_call` in other workflows.
#   It checks out the source code, executes a Windows build using a composite action,
#   and optionally saves the build artifact.
#
# INPUTS
#   - Platform        The target platform (e.g., x86, x64, ARM64).
#   - Configuration   The build configuration (e.g., Debug, Release).
#   - SaveArtifact    Boolean flag to determine if the build output should be saved.
#
# SECRETS
#   - CertificateThumbprint   Required for signing builds, passed securely as a secret.
#
# JOBS
#   - build   Executes the build process on a Windows runner.

# Good ol' prefix, cannot hide on GitHub Actions UI.
# See https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/12025
